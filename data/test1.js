  </div>

  <div class="script-dialogue">

    <b>M-Au:</b> Hi, I'm calling to book three tickets for this Thursday's tennis match. Are there any seats left?<br>
    <b>W-Br:</b> Just a few. Tickets for Thursday's match have been selling quickly.<br>

    <b>M-Cn:</b> Thank you. It's been a good year for business. I'm even considering opening a second location.<br>
    <b>W-Am:</b> Really? Well, I noticed that Sunnyvale Restaurant went out of business and the building's up for lease. It's very close to the local university. You'd probably get a lot of walk-in customers.

  <div class="script-dialogue">
    <b>[Questions 50 - 52]</b><br>

    <b>M-Au:</b> Actually, I just finished testing the game this morning. I found a problem in the third stage of the game. There were a few times when my character couldn't move.<br>
    <b>W-Br:</b> Oh, that's strange.<br>
    <b>M-Au:</b> I double-checked the problem using a different controller. The same issue came up.<br>

    <b>W-Br:</b> Why don't you tell me more about your business? I understand it's a repair shop?<br>
    <b>M2:</b> Well, 10 years ago we opened as a snowmobile repair shop, but after a few years we also started renting out snowmobiles and other sports equipment.<br>
    <b>M1:</b> Yes, and because winter tourism has increased recently, we'd like to expand our space so that we can carry more inventory.
  </div>

  <div class="script-dialogue">
    <b>[Questions 59 - 61]</b><br>
    <b>M-Au:</b> Many of our factory workers have expressed interest in upgrading their skills. I'd like to implement a peer-training program, where learners shadow more experienced employees and observe how they do their jobs.<br>
    <b>W-Am:</b> I'm afraid that might become a burden for our longtime employees. They'll have to slow down their work to explain what they're doing.<br>
    <b>M-Au:</b> What if we videotaped experienced employees doing specific tasks? High-quality video can be recorded and edited with a smartphone.<br>
    <b>W-Am:</b> I like that idea. It would allow us to capture our workers' expertise without slowing down the production line.

  </div>

  <div class="script-dialogue">
    <b>[Questions 65 - 67]</b><br>
    <b>M-Au:</b> Marion, we keep getting calls from people who want to visit the botanical garden but can't find parking information. Isn't it on our website?<br>
    <b>W-Br:</b> It is, but you have to click on the "About Us" page and scroll to the bottom of that page. Maybe people don't see it.<br>
    <b>M-Au:</b> Oh, I think we should move that information from the "About Us" page and make a separate page for directions and parking information. That way, people can find it more easily.<br>
    <b>W-Br:</b> I'd be happy to make that change, but we're in the middle of updating our software, so it'll have to wait until Monday.
  </div>

  <div class="script-dialogue">
    <b>[Questions 68 - 70]</b><br>
    <b>M-Au:</b> Good news, we have finally received the go-ahead for our department's project to install bicycle racks at the train station downtown.<br>
    <b>W-Am:</b> At last! So now we need to decide where to place the racks. How about by the station entrance?<br>
    <b>M-Au:</b> Hmm, if we ask riders, I bet they'd say that the most convenient spot is as close to the platform as possible.<br>
    <b>W-Am:</b> Let's do that. I'll contact some companies for estimates.

    <b>M-Au:</b> Welcome, new employees. My name is Diego, and I facilitate all orientation sessions. Before we start today, you will need to set up your employee account. If you look at the first page of your training binder, you'll see your username and a temporary password. Please open the laptops you were given this morning and log in using those credentials. You will then be prompted to create your own password. Once that's complete, you'll have access to all your department's files. Please note that you can only access them from your company computer.

    <b>[Questions 77 - 79]</b><br>
    <b>W-Br:</b> Hello, this is Heather Ross calling from Denville Amusement Park. About a month ago, I ordered one of your new video game machines, Space Defenders. I'm really happy with my purchase, since the game has been incredibly popular with our park guests. I'm considering buying some additional machines in the near future. I heard you may be releasing a new game soon. Could you call me back and let me know if that's true? Thanks.

    <b>[Questions 80 - 82]</b><br>
    <b>W-Am:</b> The first agenda item for our board meeting is the annual sales report. We're all disappointed by the drop in our clothing sales. The decline is mostly due to distribution issues. Because our factories are all overseas, it takes too long for orders to reach customers. So I'm recommending that we start manufacturing some clothing locally. We'll be looking for a location to build a manufacturing facility. I hired a consultant to put together a list of locations we could use. He'll be at our next board meeting to explain the pros and cons of each.

    <b>[Questions 83 - 85]</b><br>
    <b>M-Cn:</b> Attention passengers: All trains to Midway Station are delayed for track repairs. Repair crews are working on a stretch of track just south of the town of Weadon. They expect to complete the repair within the hour. We apologize for the delay. We understand that many commuters need to get to Midway as soon as possible. A bus will be departing for that destination in 15 minutes. Also, a reminder that the station café opens at 8:00 AM, and there are food kiosks on platform 1.

    <b>[Questions 86 - 88]</b><br>
    <b>W-Br:</b> I'm calling about the work my design team is doing to update your company logo. I've just emailed two versions for you to review. The first is a modern design with bold colors and simple lettering. The second image reflects the history of your brand and its logo. It's less trendy, but it doesn't depart much from the original, which you may prefer. Take your time to think about which one you'd like to choose. I'll be on vacation all next week, but if you call the office, my assistant will set up a meeting for when I get back.
  </div>

  <div class="script-dialogue">
    <b>[Questions 89 - 91]</b><br>
    <b>W-Am:</b> After the transportation agency released the draft of our improvement plan last week, members of the press asked if we're considering installing more fuel-efficient engines in our trains. I've scheduled this press conference to officially respond to your inquiries. 18 months ago, we hired a firm to determine if this upgrade would be feasible for our trains. It reported that the upgrade would be economical only for relatively new trains—that is, those less than five years old. All of ours are at least 10 years old. I hope this addresses your questions. If you're interested in more details, email our media relations department to receive a summary of the findings.

  <div class="script-dialogue">
    <b>[Questions 92 - 94]</b><br>
    <b>M-Cn:</b> As regional sales manager, I want to explore the use of a more modernized payment system in our cosmetics stores. This system would allow any sales associate to take customer payments from a tablet anywhere in the store. Why should we do this? The main complaint about shopping at our stores is waiting in long lines to pay. A lot of our stores could benefit from this, but I've decided to conduct a trial run at our store in the Center City Mall. By far, that's our busiest location.

    <b>[Questions 95 - 97]</b><br>
    <b>W-Br:</b> In local news, the downtown Reston Office Tower is completed. The most extraordinary feature of the building is its beautiful garden, located in the lobby. Reston's management office has confirmed the tenant list for the building, and we interviewed the CEO of Barnum Financial Services about its new offices. He said he and his team are excited to move in in January. A recording of the full interview with the CEO is available on our website.

    <b>[Questions 98 - 100]</b><br>
    <b>M-Au:</b> Good morning, and thank you for attending this meeting for prospective investors. ZZ Mining has been planning to expand our operations by opening an additional silver mine. Let me show you the laboratory analysis of our exploratory drilling. On the screen, you can see information about the ore extracted from different sites. The highest-grade site had 410 grams of silver per ton of ore. However, the site with 390 grams per ton has a larger deposit, so that's where we'll build the new mine. Our next step is to apply for the necessary permits. We'll do that next week.
